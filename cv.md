### About me:

I graduated from university with a degree in Finance in Saint-Petersburg. I had been working in finance department for more than 10 years before I decided to try something different.

I was always keen on automation and creation useful features to improve routine tasks more than calculating cost and profit. Thus, I made a desicion to follow my interests and find myself in IT. I finished some courses of manual testing and business intelligence. However, it seemed to be as boring as finance. So I started learning HTML/CSS. And finally, I found that Web development is the most attractive and interesting to me. I like it since the beginning and still I am fond of Front development.

In 2022 I changed my life: new country, culture, language, people. Inspite of that I keep doing my best in learning Front-end and becoming a developer one day.

So, overall I have been learning HTML/CSS and Java Script with multiple sourses for 2 years already with some short breaks. I was really excited when my friend told me about this course. I believe that the RS School will allows me to understand my level and improve my skills.

## Skills and Proficiency:

- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript Basics
- Git, GitHub
- VS Code
- Adobe Photoshop, Figma

## Code example from CODEWARS:

**Task Name**: Your order, please (6 kya)

**Description:**
Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.
Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).
If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

```
function order(words) {
let newArr = [];
const arr = words.split(" ");
for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
arr.forEach((word) => (word.includes(i) ? newArr.push(word) : ""));
}

return newArr.join(" ");
}
```
